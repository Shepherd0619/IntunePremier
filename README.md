# NOTICE
Due to Executive Order 14117, issued by Biden administration, I got no choice but to leave and no longer work at Microsoft since April 8.

For more info, please visit https://www.justice.gov/nsd/data-security#:~:text=On%20February%2028%2C%202024%2C%20the%20President%20issued%20Executive,United%20States%20Government%20Data%20by%20Countries%20of%20Concern.

I have no access to any test tenant for doing the development and testing.

And due to the fact above, the project is now planning to be **archived**, **actively looking for next maintainer or a possible test tenant**.

Until then, the project may be no longer maintained. Please use at your own risk.
